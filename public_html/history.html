THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE EXPERIENCE SINCE 1926</P></CENTER>

<P><I>An edited version of this history of Dartmouth water polo appeared
in the September-October 1998 issue of <B>Water Polo Scoreboard,</B> the
official publication of United States Water Polo, Inc.</I></P>

<P><I>Preserving the record of Dartmouth's water polo heritage is a work
  in progress. All Friends of Dartmouth Water Polo are encouraged to submit
  any additions or corrections.</I></P>
<P>If you think water polo is a recent or California sport, the long, resilient
  history of Dartmouth College water polo will surprise you. Ninth-oldest
  college in the United States, Dartmouth is a private, four-year, coeducational
  undergraduate school in Hanover, New Hampshire, with professional schools
  of business, engineering, and medicine. It focuses on liberal arts teaching
  and research for undergraduates. More than seventy years ago, a Dartmouth
  water polo team first competed intercollegiately. Today, almost fifty student-athletes
  play on the men's and women's teams. The Dartmouth men's team won last year's
  national club championship, completing its fourth consecutive regular league
  play without defeat and ending 1997 ranked as the nation's number one collegiate
  club team.</P>

<P>Dartmouth water polo is about overcoming challenges. Each of the five
  separate efforts to establish a team has had to secure the leadership, talent,
  continuity, team identity, and credibility to survive. Teams typically failed
  to outlive their founders.</P>

<P>Since 1985, however, Dartmouth water polo has grown in numbers and strength,
  building steadily on previous accomplishments. More construction remains.
  But the achievements so far provide useful insights into what it takes to
  create a successful water polo program.<br />
</P>
<P><I>In the Beginning (1926-1973)</I></P>

<P>Water polo competition dawned at Dartmouth College on Friday, December
  10, 1926, at 4 pm, but it barely resembled water polo as we know it today.
  Each team had six players. Five points were scored by touching the ball
  to the goal board defended by the opposing team. Hitting the goal board
  with a throw of at least fifteen feet scored three points. Hitting the goal
  board with a &quot;free throw&quot; after a foul scored one point. A regulation
  game consisted of two eight-minute periods.</P>

<P>The referee started play by throwing the ball to the center of the pool.
  Players dived in, and the three forwards from each team raced to get possession.
  Forwards played offense and the two backs and goal-guard played defense.
  Strategies assumed this three-on-three arrangement.</P>

<P>Play itself shared violence with rugby and football. A defender could
  tackle any offensive player within four feet of the ball. A player with
  the ball could be kept submerged indefinitely. Offensive players nearly
  drowned when they refused to release the ball. <B>John Chamberlin '31</B>,
  a Dartmouth water polo manager, recalls that &quot;the action next to the
  goal board was fierce, approaching a drowning contest.&quot; Moreover, rule
  compliance varied. As back <B>Robert Ackerberg '32</B> recollects, &quot;there
  were rules, but some of us never exactly knew what they were.&quot;</P>

<P>Classified as a minor sport, Dartmouth water polo had little visibility
  or funding. Victories were few and far between. In 1928 and 1929, the team
  won twice apiece, but lost to Navy 3-80 and 9-62. The 1930 squad failed
  to win a game.</P>

  <CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=-1>1931 Team (Robert Ackerberg '32: first row, far right)</FONT></P></CENTER>
<P>The 1931 squad therefore shocked the water polo world by finishing nearly
  undefeated and sharing the Intercollegiate Swimming League national title
  with Pennsylvania and Navy. Perhaps it was the six returning lettermen.
  Perhaps it was the coach who, according to the Dartmouth yearbook, &quot;developed
  the starless squad into a cooperating and fighting unit.&quot;</P>



<P>It was short-lived glory. The Depression made money scarce. Water polo's
  brutality frightened athletic administrators. Dartmouth eliminated water
  polo after the 1931 season, following the example set by Princeton, Brown,
  and others. Dartmouth water polo would not resurface for 35 years.</P>


<P>The Age of Aquarius gave Dartmouth water polo its second coming. The
  College had an especially strong group of sophomore swimmers. The assistant
  swimming coach promoted the team's formation in April, 1967 to keep his
  young stars conditioned during the off-season. One of them, <B>Jay Glaser
    '69</B>, recalls that when the first practice ended, &quot;we were completely
  dehydrated, completely exhausted, and completely exhilarated. We hardly
  knew how much we were killing ourselves.&quot;</P>


<P>Water polo had changed. Teams now had seven players. Goals with nets
  replaced goal boards, and a game had four 15-minute quarters. Players passed
  the inflated ball more. But polo remained physical. &quot;Water polo is
  a combination of soccer and the St. Valentine's Day Massacre,&quot; team
  co-founder <B>Mike Harvey '69</B> noted at the time.</P>

<P>The team practiced more than it played, competing sporadically. By 1973,
intercollegiate water polo disappeared from Dartmouth for a second time.<br />
</P>


<P><I>Voices Crying Out in the Wilderness (1974-1985)</I></P>


<P>In 1974, Dartmouth swimmers gave water polo its third life by reviving
  the sport, again primarily to break the monotony of swim practice. Most
  distinctive about the team's play was <B>Vincent Laudone '77</B>, who started
  each period sprinting for the ball, because he was the team's fastest swimmer,
  and immediately afterwards swimming to his goalie position, because &quot;I
  didn't mind getting hit on the head.&quot;</P>


<P>Dartmouth water polo operated on a predictably rag tag basis. Those who
  played water polo in high school taught fundamentals to the rest. Team organization
  and play suffered. During a tournament trip to Brown, the starting goalie
  detoured to pursue personal interests at all-female Wellesley College. This
  left backup goalie <B>Kevin Hoffman '78</B> to face Brown. Defense was not
  a Dartmouth strength. Despite losing badly to Brown, Hoffman managed 37
  saves, including the first that broke his nose. In 1978, the team played
  in the first Ivy League Championship.</P>


<P>Official &quot;club sport&quot; recognition came in 1979, but the team
  folded soon afterwards. Getting pool time, organizing practices, rallying
  team members to practice, teaching fundamentals to inexperienced players,
  scheduling games, planning trips, and marshaling the equipment and finances
  swamped the all-student effort.</P>


<P>Dartmouth's fourth water polo era began in the fall of 1982 when several
  students with high school experience recruited &quot;retired&quot; varsity
  swimmers and others by posting handbills at the main dining hall. The only
  balls available were a few nearly smooth Mikasas. Pool time had to be scrounged.
  Founder <B>Whit Trovillion '86</B> recalls that the team played a form of
  jungle ball. &quot;We made up in enthusiasm what we lacked in strength.&quot;</P>


<P>The team became co-ed when <B>Terry Ann Kremer '84</B> joined. Others
  joined the team briefly and left. The lack of regulation goals prevented
  play at home, so the team traveled to compete against Yale's freshmen and
  the prep students at Andover and Exeter. The prep students never appreciated
  Dartmouth's unskilled physical approach to the game.</P>


<P>Most of the team's core competency graduated by 1984. Dartmouth water
  polo faded for the fourth time.<br />
</P>


<P><I>Re-Genesis (1985-1989)</I></P>



<P>Water polo's irresistible attraction continued, for late in the fall
  of 1985, six students met to organize the fifth water polo team in Dartmouth
  history. Practices began in the winter after a player purchased balls in
  Boston during one of his social expeditions.</P>


<P>Once again, the few experienced players had to teach fundamentals to
  the others. More players joined. Because Dartmouth's spring term starts
  at the end of March, the new team missed most of the spring season. Fortunately,
  the player whose social connections in Boston made ball purchase possible
  also had a social connection at Mt. Holyoke. He arranged a match. The Dartmouth
  team overcame a fifty pound per player average weight disadvantage and triumphed
  15-1.</P>


<P><B>Steve O'Connell '89</B> emerged as the principal team leader the following
  fall. He represented the team at the scheduling meeting of the fledgling
  New England Water Polo Association (which subsequently expanded into the
  Eastern Water Polo Association and then into today's Collegiate Water Polo
  Association). He came to campus early to advertise water polo to freshmen
  as they entered the dining hall during their pre-school orientation. The
  roster swelled.</P>


<P>Pool time remained inadequate and inconvenient. Equipment was minimal.
  Travel depended on personal cars. Housing at away tournaments came down
  to the floors in dormitory living rooms. Conditioning was painfully absent,
  resulting in fourth period collapses. The player-coach arrangement hindered
  appropriate adjustments and substitution. Despite it all, the Dartmouth
  team managed a 4-5 record.</P>


<P>The fall of 1986 also ended with a visit from a representative of the
  Dartmouth Alumni Association of Silicon Valley. The alumni association wanted
  a club project that would promote a sport of interest to Northern California
  alumni and would eventually bring a Dartmouth athletic team periodically
  to Northern California. The assembled team members declared their acceptance.
  Dartmouth water polo gained a sponsor and more important, a source of continuity
  and non-student backing.</P>


<P>Externally, Dartmouth water polo progressed at best modestly over the
  six years from the fall of 1987 through the fall of 1993. Each fall the
  team's captain would discover that only a few of the previous year's players
  could be counted on to play again. This forced finding an entirely new team.
  It did not help that the admissions office, athletic department, and swim
  coach routinely denied the existence of a Dartmouth water polo team. It
  did not help that the team typically practiced a week or less before playing
  its first regular season tournament. It did not help that most of the new
  players were equally new to water polo. Water polo practice unavoidably
  focused on basics. The season itself lasted less than eight weeks. No additional
  games were scheduled; the student leadership had enough trouble arranging
  the logistics for the league tournaments. Pool time was never sufficient
  or convenient.</P>


<P>Internally, Dartmouth water polo strengthened steadily. The alumni association
  recruited Dartmouth's new director of development as the team's advisor.
  The advisor helped the student's cut through bureaucratic barriers. He helped
  new team leaders learn about what had been done in the past and what needed
  to be done next. He opened his home for team social functions. He helped
  build a much-needed new goal. The Dartmouth Alumni Association of Silicon
  Valley provided moral support, modest supplementary funds, and sponsorship
  of an occasional team dinner. Dartmouth water polo's existence no longer
  rested solely on undergraduate shoulders.</P>


<P>Another key ingredient was the arrival of <B>George Benz '92</B> in the
  fall of 1988. With Steve O'Connell entering his senior year, the leadership
  succession that had sunk previous teams threatened Dartmouth water polo
  again. Benz proved to be the right person at the right time. A starter on
  Palo Alto High School's nationally ranked team, Benz had credentials and
  charisma to bind players to the team. In competition, Benz's experience,
  training, athletic skill, confidence, and creative rule compliance compensated
  for his smaller size. He was second-team All-Ivy his freshman year.</P>


<P>But Benz also had a talent for teaching the sport and instilling loyalty.
  He patiently introduced basic skills. He would come to practice when sick,
  teaching from the deck and simultaneously teaching by example about commitment.
  Other lessons followed. An oft-repeated legend arose from the game when
  Captain Benz marched up to the foot taller opposing team captain and snarled
  &quot;Fear me.&quot; The incident ignited pride, a newfound sense of team,
  as memorialized in team t-shirts (the first in years) worn on campus throughout
  the year.</P>

<P>All the founders of the fifth Dartmouth water polo team had graduated
  when the 1980s concluded. Dartmouth water polo nevertheless survived.</P>


<P>It was the beginning of the end of the beginning.<br />
</P>


<P><I>Work in Progress (1990-1993)</I></P>


<P>Massive turnover, poor conditioning, and inconsistent practice and game
  participation still thwarted competition performance. Victories were rare.
  Yet team infrastructure kept improving.</P>


<P>A new position of president assumed many administrative responsibilities
  previously juggled by the captain alone. Completion of the first Northern
  California training trip during the spring break of 1992 marked a significant
  breakthrough. The feat demonstrated how far the team had traveled organizationally.</P>


<P><B>Brent Schindele '93</B> assumed the captaincy on George Benz's graduation,
  marking yet another successful leadership transfer. A veteran of Southern
  California water polo, Schindele also combined playing ability with leadership
  skills.</P>


<P>Competition in the fall of 1992 was disappointing. To move forward, the
  team needed a non-player coach who could drive the team in practice and
  in play without the handicaps of managing peers or trying to coach while
  trying to play.</P>

<P>Finding and paying a coach was another matter. Several attempts ended
unsuccessfully. In late September, Dartmouth's Athletic Department hired
Jim Wilson, late of the University of Utah, as the new swimming coach. None
of the swimmers or water polo players knew much about him. Research by the
alumni representative from the Dartmouth Alumni Association of Silicon Valley
revealed that Wilson had played polo in high school and coached the Utah
team from 1980 to 1989 before its elimination. It looked promising.</P>


<P><B>Bob Halk '94</B> took over as captain in the fall of 1993. He convinced
  the team to begin training a week before classes started, another breakthrough.
  The freshmen class was especially talented, and the fall 1993 season started
  with the team winning all four games at its first tournament. Teams with
  better defense soured the record in the next. The slide continued. Team
  unity in and out of the pool faltered. Several starters insisted on driving
  to the Ivy League Championship at Harvard in a separate car. They arrived

  after the half, and a game was lost that could have been won. Poor teamwork
  and conditioning lost the remaining games as well. Internal dissension mounted.
  The outgoing team president refused to leave the pool when his substitution
  was called.</P>


<P>The alumni representative shuttle negotiated between the players and
  Coach Wilson. Coach Wilson said he would work with the team if the players
  invited him to do so. At a lunch organized by the alumni representative,
  each player expressed desire for a serious water polo team with more work
  and some players perhaps getting benched. Each player also wanted Jim Wilson
  to be the coach. The social contract was forged.</P>


<P><I>&quot;It Is He Who Was Promised&quot;</I></P>


<P>Coach Wilson met with the Dartmouth water polo team during the winter.
  He started working with the team in spring. Because Dartmouth's head water
  polo and men's swimming coach were one and the same Jim Wilson, swimmers
  could play polo without getting caught between conflicting coaches. Practices
  were soon larger than they had been in the fall. Coach Wilson organized
  the first home water polo tournament in nearly a decade. His unchallenged
  training and game direction effectively mobilized the team's talent. The
  alumni representative asked a senior how Wilson measured up as a coach.
  Remembering the many false starts in finding a coach before Jim Wilson arrived,
  the player responded prophetically: &quot;It is he who was promised.&quot;</P>


<P>The following fall's competition revealed the progress. Dartmouth defeated
  all of its Eastern Division opponents, the first perfect regular season
  in Dartmouth history. At the Eastern Water Polo Association Championships,
  Dartmouth lost a close game against home team Yale but won the rest of its
  games and an invitation to Nationals in early November. At Nationals, Dartmouth
  avenged Easterns by beating Yale in the opening game. The powerhouse Army
  team defeated Dartmouth 10-7, but it was Army's closest game that year.
  Dartmouth not only played at Nationals, a feat unimaginable a few years
  earlier, it placed third. Dartmouth water polo had become a national power.</P>

<P>Coach Wilson capitalized on the team administration painstakingly built
since the late 1980s. Now when prospective water polo or swimming athletes
asked whether Dartmouth had a water polo team, they got a firm, enthusiastically
positive answer. Unlike the student leadership that had often waited until
fall to arrange competition and practice schedules, Wilson had everything
set before summer. Team t-shirts and caps were ordered for delivery in time
for the new season. An eight-page newsletter, complete with photographs,
triumphed the previous year's remarkable achievements to team alumni, parents,
and other friends. Fifteen players at a practice triggered celebration in
the early 1990s; now anything less than twenty caused concern. Finding enough
players to avoid a forfeit had preoccupied the team in former days; now
Dartmouth fielded not one but two squads in intercollegiate competition.</P>

<P>Dartmouth began the 1995 season ranked fourth in the nation. The A team
won its second division championship without defeat, but losing the EWPA
Championships semifinals ended the season abruptly. Time was not wasted
in despair. Dartmouth changed divisions to gain better competition before
entering championship play. The players organized dinners and other activities
to weld a tighter team. Even small measures, such as a structured pre-game
warm-up drill, fortified team unity.</P>


<P>Growing water polo interest among Dartmouth women produced the Dartmouth
  women's team, also under Coach Wilson's command. It practiced hard and participated
  fully in the Collegiate Water Polo Association's spring 1996 season. The
  new women's team advanced quickly through the leadership of players with
  national level high school experience, such as <B>Anne Soutter '96</B>,
  <B>Alyson Wilson '97</B>, and <B>Stephanie Adamson '98</B>.</P>


<P>With help from the alumni association sponsors, the men's team trained
  in Northern California and scrimmaged against tough California teams. This
  prepared Dartmouth well, and in the fall of 1996, it swept undefeated to
  a New England Division championship and a second trip to Nationals. Only
  an untimely second game loss limited Dartmouth to fifth place. The women's
  team also made major strides in the spring, winning more games and showing
  greater teamwork.</P>


<P>Nothing better reflected Dartmouth water polo's rich history than having
  <B>Robert Ackerberg '32 </B>from the 1931 championship team in the spectator
  stands at the 1996 Nationals. The team enjoyed a record year of fundraising.
  Prospective players now contacted the team while still in high school. Attrition
  almost disappeared. Team members wore team jackets and t-shirts on campus
  and proudly declared that they played water polo as their sport.</P>

<P>The team's progress in heart, mind, body, and soul came to fruition in
the fall of 1997. The men's team trained for a week in Southern California,
followed by a weekend of intense competition in Northern California. Undefeated
in regular league play for the fourth consecutive year, Dartmouth suffered
a difficult loss in the hard-fought New England Division finals but played
some of its best water polo to win every game at Nationals, becoming the National Champions for the 1997 season.The women's team continued its team building that spring, swiftly
following in the men's team's tracks.</P>

      <p>1997 Championship Team</p>
    </CENTER>
<p>  The team continued with several successful seasons after the '97 national championship. The team continued its success in the regional division, claiming regional titles in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2001. In 2006, legendary coach Jim Wilson handed the reins to polo veteran, Randy Budner. Though Wilson still influenced the direction of the sport, Coach Randy Budner was in charge. In the 2008-2009 season, the team led by graduate student <strong>Nick Riolo Tuck '09, </strong>brothers <strong>Michael and Dan Bazlewicz</strong> <strong>DMS '09</strong>, and seniors <strong>Porter Diehl '09</strong> and <strong>Kyle Finnegan '09</strong> capped an 11-1 season, avenging their only loss by beating Boston College in the New England Division Championship finals and earning a bid to the National Tournament in Athens, Ohio. The team finished 8th place in the nation, once again standing atop the New England Division.</p>

<p>In 2012, the team reclaimed the top spot in the New England Division. After losing to 7-5 to UCLA in the fifth place game, the team claimed sixth place at Nationals. In 2013, the team kept their claim on the top spot in the New England Division, and once again the team went to nationals. Seeking a berth to the finals, the team faced UCLA once again, but fell in a close game 10-8. After another close loss to Cal the next morning, Dartmouth was still able to improve on their 2012 result with a fourth place finish at Nationals. </p>
